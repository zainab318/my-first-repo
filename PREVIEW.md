👾 [Narrator]: In a galaxy not so far away, where code twinkles like stars and dreams race at the speed of light...
A new journey is about to begin.

✨ Name: Zainab Rauf
🎓 Computer Science student (GPA: 3.93)
💻 Languages: C & C++ (school adventures!)
🤖 AI & Robotics Summer Camp: PTCL, 2021
🚗 Dream: To blend AI with automotive engineering and design intelligent vehicles!

════════════════════════════════════════════════

Once upon a terminal...
A spark was lit at a summer camp, and curiosity became a calling.
Now, Zainab codes not just for grades, but for the thrill of invention—
to one day craft vehicles that think, learn, and inspire.

Every journey begins with a single line of code.

🌟 The adventure is just beginning...
Stay curious. Stay bold.
To be continued... 🚀
